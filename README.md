# LAB 3

In this Lab the student had the task to implement a map with additional layers by using the code in lab 2.

To achieve this the student had to use MapBox, add the layers that were requested and instert the final map into the existing project. The data that had to be shown in the layers of the new map, was the City of Calgary Traffic Incidents of year 2017.
This data was to be used in CSV format so MapBox could read it.
After the data was collected and uploaded into the map toolbox, the student had to choose how this data was going to be shown and 
what changes he wanted to make to make the map more presentable.
For this reason the student had added a heatmap as well.

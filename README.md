For lab2, the student has created a website where the use would be able to get access to building permits in the city of calgary depending on the dates that the user would input.

The code consits of two main sections:
-HTML: Main.html
-Java: Design.css

-----------------Main.html----------------

In the Main.html file most of the code regrading the website can be found. 
The implementation of the api to get the permits, the map to overlay the data on, the url for the map, heading etc... can be found here.

The code is written so the user can have their input in the website and by using this input, the proper permits would be collected by the City of calgary website and be displayed in the map.
The map is given a certain point of zoom and a zoom level. The map is intereactive as well.




----------------Design.css-----------------

In this part, some id-s were created to give attributes to some of the elements found in the HTML file.
Three id-s were created, for the map and the headers.
